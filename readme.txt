--- Status Notes---
1. Long site titels are cut off in Toolbar just like WordPress admin bar default behaviour.
2. Users are required to keep the Toolbar on to get full advantage of the theme.
3. If you want to add navigation you need to go to Appearance > Menu and it will appear in the admin bar or you can 
add to a sidebar widget area.
