03/12/2011 : 
- Need to find some way to show on front not just use index.php for the activity - that is the only view
- From now on set to activity front page until get solution to above
- No sidebar so get rid
- Change default font being used
- Don't put max-width on body put on wrapper for responsive
- Call it site-wrapper to be more semantic
- Remove padder classes as we can do in divs better to control on responsive
- Get rid of 1% padding on nav, content and padder won't be using - easier to control for multiple devices
- Make header fit to design
- Make full width front page
- Remove site-wrapper create section wrappers
- Better default link colour
- Keep normlising in normalise.css not in status-main.css
- Remove any 1% paddings put on each element as style for ease
- Just set max-width on img for ease
- Remove content-wrap and use container as the wrapper for content section
- Create a content-profile that uses a sidebar and also not full width content
- Comment out the navigation on the activity stream for now until decide if using

Key things that need doing:
- Need to have the comments show / hide so you can view on clicking the comments - need scripting for this - any ideas?
- We also need to merge the navigation into the buddybar - any ideas?
